# pallavi_learning_path
This repository serves as my personal learning journal and portfolio. Here, I document my progress, notes, projects, and experiments across various topics and technologies I am exploring. It is a collection of practical examples, code snippets, and learning resources that help me grow my skills and track my development journey.
